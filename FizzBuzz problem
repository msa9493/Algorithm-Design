# Fizz Buzz problem from Leet Code

# Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n.

# But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. 
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.


class Solution:
    def fizzBuzz(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        numb = []
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if (i%3 == 0) & (i%5 == 0):
                i = "FizzBuzz"
            elif (i%3 == 0):
                i = "Fizz"
            elif (i%5 == 0):
                i = "Buzz"
            else:
                i = str(i)
            numb.append(i)
